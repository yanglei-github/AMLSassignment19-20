# AMLSassignment19_20
This is the AMLS assignment project, which contains four models and the two datasets(celeb,cartoon_set) we used. The dataset celeb is a sub-set of a celebrity image dataset(*S. Yang, P. Luo, C. C. Loy, and X. Tang, "From facial parts responses to face detection: A Deep Learning Approach", in IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015*). And the dataset cartoon_set is a sub-set of Cartoon Set, which could be found in *https://google.github.io/cartoonset/*.(The dataset can be found in my google drive)

The code of four tasks are encapsulated as four modules in their folders(A1,A2,B1,B2). In main.py, you can easily import these four model, for example, by using code 'import A1'.

The following packages are required to run my code:

numpy, pandas,  matplotlib.pyplotï¼ŒPIL, cv2, sklearn(sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.decomposition, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.pipeline, sklearn.linear_model), time



Note:

Highly recommend for using Pycharm to open the whole project(Pycharm can automatically detect the path of my module A1,A2,B1,B2 in my project).
